## Sometimes all you need is this tree...

- to represent, store, walk, manipulate, and search some hierarchical information with the purpose of deciding, routing, sorting, or composing results.

### ...but often you really don't!

- when one of the standard associative containers do better: `std::unordered_map`, `std::unordered_set`, `std::unordered_multimap`, `std::unordered_multiset`, or
- when one of the standard sorted associative containers do better: `std::map`, `std::set`, `std::multi_map`, `std::multi_set`, or
- when one of the many algorithms, parsers do better, or
- when one of the [100+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Trees_(data_structures)) other trees do better: binary, ternary, m-ary, k-ary, red-black, k-d, B, B+ trees!

### Design Tradeoffs

The selected design tradeoffs are:
- the Standard Template Library (STL) principles, and by extension, their tradeoffs,
- the C++ Core Guidelines, and
- the C++20 support.

## Class fcarouge::tree

Defined in header [fcarouge/tree.hpp](include/fcarouge/tree.hpp)

```
template <
    class Type,
    class AllocatorType = std::allocator<Type>
> class tree
```

The `fcarouge::tree` type is a hierarchical tree data structure. The container is a non-linear non-associative unordered recursively referenced collection of nodes, each containing a value. The design tradeoffs are influenced by the Standard Template Library (STL) principles and the C++ Core Guidelines. The container is a standard layout class type which may help with memory and cross language communication. The iteration order of the standard iterator is unspecified, except that each element is visited only once.

### Template Parameters

| Template Parameter | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `Type` | The type of the contained data elements. |
| `AllocatorType` | An allocator that is used to acquire/release memory and to construct/destroy the elements in that memory. |

### Member Types

| Member Type | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `value_type` | The type of the contained data elements. |
| `allocator_type` | The type of the allocator for all memory allocations of this container. |
| `size_type` | The unsigned integer type to represent element counts. |
| `difference_type` | Signed integer type to represent element distances. |
| `reference` | The reference type of the contained data elements. |
| `const_reference` | The constant reference type of the contained data elements. |
| `pointer` | The pointer type of the contained data elements. |
| `const_pointer` | The const pointer type of the contained data elements. |
| `iterator` | Type to identify and traverse the elements of the container. |
| `const_iterator` | Constant type to identify and traverse the elements of the container. |

### Member Functions

| Member Function | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `(constructor)` | Constructs the container. |
| `(destructor)` | Destructs the container. |
| `operator=` | Assigns values to the container. |
| `assign` | Assigns values to the container. |
| `get_allocator` | Returns the allocator associated with the container. |

#### Element Access

| Element Access | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `front` | Returns a reference to the first element in the container. |

#### Iterators

| Iterator | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `begin` <br>`cbegin` | Returns an iterator to the first element of the container. |
| `end` <br>`cend` | Returns an iterator to the element following the last element of the container. |

#### Capacity

| Capacity | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `empty` | Checks if the container has no elements. |
| `size` | Returns the number of elements in the container. |
| `max_size` | Returns the maximum number of elements the container is able to hold. |

#### Modifiers

| Modifier | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `clear` | Erases all elements from the container. |
| `insert` | Inserts a new element into the container directly before the position iterator as the new left sibling. |
| `emplace_front` | Inserts a new element into the container constructed in-place directly before the root beginning. |
| `emplace` | Inserts a new element into the container constructed in-place directly before the position iterator as the new left sibling. |
| `erase` | Prunes the specified element including its sub-tree. |
| `push` | Inserts the given element value into the container directly after the last child of the position iterator as the new last child. |
| `push_front` | Prepends the given element to the beginning of the container. |
| `swap` | Exchanges the contents of this container with those of the other container. |

### Example

![Hello, World! Tree](https://francoiscarouge.github.io/Tree/dot_inline_dotgraph_1.png)

```cpp
// Support the tree container in this program by including its definition.
#include "fcarouge/tree.hpp"

// For convenience in this example, consider not using in production.
using namespace fcarouge;

int main(int, char **)
{
  // Declare a "greeting" variable as a tree of strings type.
  tree<std::string> greeting;

  // Push at the front of the tree a root element with string value "Hello, ".
  greeting.push_front("Hello, ");

  // Push in an element with value "Wo" as a child of the beginning, root node.
  greeting.push(greeting.begin(), "Wo");

  // Push in another element with value "d!" and keep its iterator "i".
  const tree<std::string>::iterator i = greeting.push(greeting.begin(), "d!");

  // Insert a left sibling of iterator "i", child of the root, with value "rl".
  greeting.emplace(i, "rl");

  return 0;
}
```
