## Use Cases

**Sometimes all you need is this tree...**

- to represent, store, walk, manipulate, and search some **hierarchical** information with the purpose of deciding, routing, sorting, or composing results,

**...but often you really don't!**

- when one of the standard associative containers do better: `std::unordered_map`, `std::unordered_set`, `std::unordered_multimap`, `std::unordered_multiset`, or
- when one of the standard sorted associative containers do better: `std::map`, `std::set`, `std::multi_map`, `std::multi_set`, or
- when one of the many algorithms, parsers do better, or
- when one of the [100+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Trees_(data_structures)) other trees do better: binary, ternary, m-ary, k-ary, red-black, k-d, B, B+ trees!

## Example

`main.cpp`
```cpp
#include <iostream>
// std::cout std::endl

#include "fcarouge/tree.hpp"
// fcarouge::tree

int main(int, char **)
{
  // Declare a "greeting" variable as a tree of aliased standard strings.
  fcarouge::tree_string greeting;

  // Push at the front of the tree a root element with string value "Hello".
  const auto root = greeting.emplace(greeting.begin(), "Hello");

  // Push in an element with value "," as a child of the sole node.
  greeting.push(root, ",");

  // Push in another element with value "!" and keep its iterator "bang".
  const auto bang = greeting.push(root, "!");

  // Insert a left sibling of iterator "bang" with value "World".
  greeting.emplace(bang, "World");

  // Print out the contents of the container.
  std::cout << greeting << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
Hello
├── ,
├── World
└── !
```

## Class fcarouge::tree

Defined in header [fcarouge/tree.hpp](include/fcarouge/tree.hpp)

```
template <
    class Type,
    class AllocatorType = std::allocator<Type>
> class tree
```

The `fcarouge::tree` type is a hierarchical tree data structure. The container is:
- generic with respect to the type of stored values and allocator as template parameters,
- non-linear compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues as a node may lead to multiple nodes,
- non-associative compared to maps and sets as values are not keyed,
- unordered since internally, the elements are not sorted or maintained in any particular order but externally, the insertion order is upheld,
- recursive in its facade exposing a recursively referenced collection of nodes, each containing a value,
- standard layout class type which may help with memory and cross language communication,
- unspecified iteration order except that each element is visited only once,
- implemented operations without recursive calls to guarantee a constant stack usage limit,
- compile time evaluation compatible,
- employing generational C++ features advantageously up to C++20 standard,
- separating algorithmic from container concerns,
- influenced by the Standard Template Library (STL) principles and the C++ Core Guidelines in its design tradeoffs,
- intelligibly documented for the wider audience.

### Template Parameters

| `emplace_front` | Inserts a new element into the container constructed in-place directly before the root beginning. |
| `emplace` | Inserts a new element into the container constructed in-place directly before the position iterator as the new left sibling. |
| `erase` | Prunes the specified element including its sub-tree. |
| `push` | Inserts the given element value into the container directly after the last child of the position iterator as the new last child. |

## Hard Lessons Learned

- Recursive code **will** run out of stack space. No matter the architecture, for a generic data structure that cannot guarantee depth by design. Refactor to iterative code.
